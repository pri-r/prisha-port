          One of the previous projects that I have worked on is 'Catch-the-Capy' game. It was my first step into game development. 
          After working <br></br> on it for 4hrs straight, I sadly realised that the game will not reach the halls of fame for being cute and earn me millions.

          But a cute game did come out of my sad realisation. You can try it out by clicking on the image.

          My first attempt at making a website was for a technical challange presented by Devsoc, where I learned all about HTML, CSS and Javascript<br></br> to build a website 
          based on the notion of time, I created a few functions to enable the backround to change colour as you scroll further down,<br></br> which was an incredible learning experience for me. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I also made it Cinderalla themed. Always running out of time.

          This project is still under construction, called BooDo. It is your productive day planner that takes inspiration from the app Todoist, 
          and includes <br></br> my own creative elements to compete against your friends/teammates and gain points from completing tasks.
